# Deployment and Securing of a Hybrid Infrastructure with Proxmox

## Project Context

This project is carried out as part of the **Cloud Infrastructure Architects (CIA)** program.  
The objective is to design, deploy, and secure a **hybrid infrastructure** composed of two Proxmox sites:

- **Site 1**: On-premise
- **Site 2**: Remote

The infrastructure must be secure, scalable, documented, and reproducible, following industry best practices.

This repository contains the **documentation, planning, diagrams, and configuration artifacts** related to the project.
